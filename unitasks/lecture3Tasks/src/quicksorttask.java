//  Quicksort is an algorithm which sorts an array as follows: take the last element of the
// array (then called pivot) and divide the rest of the array into two arrays: the elements
// which are smaller than or equal to the pivot and the ones which are greater. Then treat
// recursively the so-obtained arrays.
